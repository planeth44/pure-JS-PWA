~ REFACTOR
- [ ] refactor syncStatus values as const in ???
- [ ] refactor syncController. Extract call to fetch to its own method
- [ ] syncController transmitText should update w/ syncStatus = 'failed' if response.code >= 400

~ DESIGN
- [ ] explore making a Model class with method getFromPath, setFRomPath, toFormData 
- [ ] add a lastRefreshTs mechanism to throttle call to sync
- [ ] Add a mechanism to sync without being in edit page + trigger a 'done'
- [ ] explore syncing / update of theModel [/]
  - [ ] add a version in theModel
  - [ ] call to sync should send uuid + version 
  - [ ] response to sync should send diff on uuid+version
  - [ ] call update on response
  - [ ] modelController should set syncStatus=update whe necessary
- [ ] explore implementing images caching after upload/sync to distant server
  - see syncController@cachePhoto
  - URL could be in the form of images/<parentUuid>/<uuid>

~ BEHAVIOUR
- [ ] ModelController. Done button should trigger validation. And stop to ask to change if need
- [ ] Home page -> add method to check for pending instances
- [ ] ModelController. 
  - Cancel button should remove the instance ? If yes remove associated docs
  - For now reset clear all the fields but the model is not cleared. 
    Should ask the user if want to clear the model
- [ ] test offline mode when trying to sync
- [ ] add an option to clear user-notification after timeout

~ UI
- [ ] Add files & photos in /edit/<uuid>
- [ ] Better UI for /show
- [ ] implement /document/failed view + controller

~ README
- [ ] Locality of behavior (one controller for the page)



~ DONE
- [X] Sync w/ distant server 
- [X] fileController should have the fileModel at the top
- [X] style user.notification / should be less present
- [X] remove all flpwa- classes
